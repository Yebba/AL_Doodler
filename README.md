# Hi! Here's how to run this app on Android Studio
## Step 1: Connecting to this repository
Open Android Studio on your computer (you might have to close a project if you have one open). Click the "Open from VCS" button near the top right corner. ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/955dbc0c-b118-459c-82d1-5b98d0ebe749)
From here, we'll be on the Repository URL tab. We can choose "Git" in the Version Control drop down box, and then input the URL for this repository. After that, we can edit the local Directory path if needed. Then hit the "Clone" button to clone the repository to your local computer. Once the repository is cloned, Android Studio code editor will open. ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d7cc126-5d28-407f-bda8-7078f5aab6cc)

## Step 2: Finishing the set up in the code editor
When you first open the repository for the first time, you may get this notifications (circled in red). Just select "Automatically Add" for the first one and select the first available JDK option for the second. You may also have to do a clean build of the project or invalidate the cache to get everything set up (see here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34421193/could-not-determine-the-dependencies-of-task-appcrashlyticsstoredeobsdebug-i). ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5e4cee-f689-4b9e-92f4-fc6225c729a7)

##  Step 3: Running the app on the emulator
Once the everything is set up in the code editor, click the "play" (green triangle) button near the top of the screen to run the app on the emulator. If everything is set up correctly, then the app should load on the emulator. ![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb380a04-8465-4263-a129-dec7181a1204)
